# House Sales Analysis in a Northwestern County

## Overview
This project aims to analyze house sales in a northwestern county using multiple linear regression modeling. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to stakeholders, such as a real estate agency or homeowners, on how home renovations might increase the estimated value of properties.


## Project Objectives

- Perform data analysis and regression modeling to understand the factors influencing house prices.
- Develop predictive models to estimate the value of homes based on various features.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and interpret the results.
- Provide recommendations for homeowners on how specific renovations may impact property value.


## Business and Data Understanding
### Stakeholder Audience
The primary stakeholder audience for this project is a real estate agency that helps homeowners buy and sell homes. The agency seeks to provide accurate and data-driven advice to homeowners about how specific renovations can impact the estimated value of their properties. By understanding the factors that influence house prices, the agency can guide homeowners in making informed decisions about renovations and potentially increase their property values.

### Dataset
The project utilizes the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in the `data/` folder of this repository (`kc_house_data.csv`). The dataset provides information on various features of the houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, grade, and more. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the factors that affect house prices in the northwestern county.

## Modeling
To achieve the project objectives, we employ a regression modeling approach. Specifically, we use multiple linear regression to understand the relationship between the independent variables (house features) and the dependent variable (house price). By building regression models, we can estimate the impact of different features on the house prices and make predictions about the value of a property based on its characteristics.

## Regression Results
After exploring and refining multiple regression models, we present the findings of the final model. The model is evaluated based on appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to assess its performance and predictive accuracy. Additionally, we highlight the coefficients of the regression model to identify the features that have the most significant impact on house prices. By interpreting these coefficients, we can provide actionable insights and recommendations for the stakeholders.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project provides valuable insights into house sales in a northwestern county using regression modeling. By analyzing the King County House Sales dataset and building regression models, we have gained a deeper understanding of the factors that influence house prices. This knowledge enables us to provide informed recommendations to our stakeholders, helping them make strategic decisions about home renovations and potentially increase their property values. By leveraging regression modeling techniques, we offer data-driven insights that add value to the analysis and decision-making process for our stakeholder audience.
